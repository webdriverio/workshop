Setup Environment
=================

## Setup Project Directory

As we walk through each chapter we will build up a project that we can use as to run automated tests with WebdriverIO. To check in all changes, let's create a directory for it and init git:

```sh
$ cd ~
$ mkdir ./webdriverio-hands-on
$ cd ./webdriverio-hands-on
$ git init
```

If you don't have git installed you can leave out that step and don't check in. There are various of [documentations](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) that will get you up and running with Git.
