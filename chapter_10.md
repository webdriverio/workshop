PWA Testing
===========

A progressive web application is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices<sup>[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)]</sup>.

To ensure our example application fulfills the requirements of a PWA we can use the [`checkPWA`](https://webdriver.io/docs/devtools-service#pwa-testing) command from the `@wdio/devtools-service`. The objectives for this chapter are:

- add a test that tests our example to be a valid PWA
